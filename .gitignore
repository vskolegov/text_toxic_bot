# Model weight files (usually large) — track with Git LFS instead of git
# Uncomment to ignore model weights completely:
# text_toxic_bot/models/*.pth
# text_toxic_bot/models/*.pt
# text_toxic_bot/models/*.bin
# text_toxic_bot/models/*.ckpt

# Alternatively, ignore by extension globally
*.pth
*.pt
*.bin
*.ckpt

# If you want to keep some small model artifacts, add exceptions, for example:
# !text_toxic_bot/models/README.md
